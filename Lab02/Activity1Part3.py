# Lab 02 Activity 1 Part 3- all instructions
# 09/05/2018

# Answers to questions:
# This is the best program because it is very detailed unlike the other sets of instructions.
# Sets of sequences differed in unit of measurement (number of steps, 90 degree turns).
# Sets were similar as we all used street names or mentioning sidewalks. Also all using walk commands.
# Ryan's is easiest to use for a person familiar with the campus to follow.
# Mason's for a person in a wheelchair because of good degree-turn instructions.
# Kelsey's for a visitor trying to get to MSC because of how detailed the instructions are.
# To make it a better question to make the instructions, we should know how specific the instructions should be.
